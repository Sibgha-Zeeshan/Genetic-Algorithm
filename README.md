**Description:**
Given a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, and a maximum weight capacity for the knapsack. Implement a genetic algorithm to find the combination of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the weight capacity.

- **Initialize the Population:** Generate an initial population of random solutions.
- **Fitness Calculation:** Write a function to calculate the fitness of an individual based on the total value of items in the knapsack.
- **Selection:** Implement tournament selection to select the fittest individuals for reproduction.
- **Crossover:** Implement single-point crossover to combine pairs of individuals to produce offspring.
- **Mutation:** Implement flip mutation to introduce random changes to the offspring.
- **Next Generation:** Create the next generation by selecting parents, performing crossover, and applying mutation.
- **Find the Best Solution:** Run the genetic algorithm for a fixed number of generations and find the best solution.
